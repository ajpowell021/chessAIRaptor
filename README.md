Final Turn in Version

This was a class project completed for my university's Capstone class. I was a member of a five person team
and we developed this over the course of a semester. Specifically I wrote all of the javascript that controls 
the actual board and the pieces moving around on it. I also assisted with the artificial intelligence but my main 
focus was the actual chess game. Project was created in Unity and written in a mix of javascript and C#.
